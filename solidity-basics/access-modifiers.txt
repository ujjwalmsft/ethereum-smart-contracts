external:
External functions are part of the contract interface, 
which means they can be called from other contracts and via transactions. 
An external function f cannot be called internally (i.e. f() does not work, but this.f() works). 
External functions are sometimes more efficient when they receive large arrays of data.

public:
Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via messages. 
For public state variables, an automatic getter function (see below) is generated.

internal:
Those functions and state variables can only be accessed internally 
(i.e. from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it), 
without using this.

private:
Private functions and state variables are only visible for the contract they are defined in and not in derived contracts.
